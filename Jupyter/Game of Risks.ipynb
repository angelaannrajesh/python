When you start the game, you get a number, which is from 1 - 7, and the computer chooses a number; it doesn't know what number you got, so there is no cheating, but you can choose whether to roll again one more time if your number is really low, it's not guaranteed you'll get a higher number, so be wise and take risks, there will be questions during the game, so don't get frustrated if you don't understand the instructions.\"\n",
